In both .py files, there are comments explaining the different blocks of code.

In order to run the example generator, you must first install Python 3 (>= 3.6) and Hypothesis.

You can get Python 3 here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

To install Hypothesis, you can follow the instructions here: https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#installing

Once both of these are downloaded, you can simply run the generator by executing the following command in the same folder where both
example_generator.py and properties.py are present:
python3 example_generator.py
